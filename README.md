# Emotion-detection-from-text


   In this era of AI, knowing the correct emotion of customers is the best way of marketing and gaining more revenue.
 
   companies are coming up with new ways to understand their consumers. Detecting emotions accurately from the reviews, chats, tweets, blogs, posts, etc. is one such method without explicitly asking the customers. With the advent of new algorithms and increasing computing power, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has enabled us to detect emotions from written text & take action accordingly.

   ‘Emotion detection’ is one level deeper than the typical sentiment classification problem in the NLP world. In sentiment analysis, polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) is the primary concern, whereas, in emotion detection, the emotional or psychological state is detected. Sentiment analysis is highly subjective, whereas emotion detection is more objective and precise.
