# Emotion-detection-from-text


   In this era of AI, knowing the correct emotion of customers is the best way of marketing and gaining more revenue.
 
   companies are coming up with new ways to understand their consumers. Detecting emotions accurately from the reviews, chats, tweets, blogs, posts, etc. is one such method without explicitly asking the customers. With the advent of new algorithms and increasing computing power, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has enabled us to detect emotions from written text & take action accordingly.

   ‘Emotion detection’ is one level deeper than the typical sentiment classification problem in the NLP world. In sentiment analysis, polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) is the primary concern, whereas, in emotion detection, the emotional or psychological state is detected. Sentiment analysis is highly subjective, whereas emotion detection is more objective and precise.

 
   Here, I have used pre-trained bert model to predict the emotion of customers.
   
   What’s BERT? BERT is a computational model that converts words into numbers. This process is crucial because machine learning models take in numbers (not words) as inputs, so an algorithm that converts words into numbers allows you to train machine learning models on your originally-textual data.
